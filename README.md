 ### Project Visualization Insights

#### 1. Funnel Chart

This represents the stage of each category.

#### 2. Area Chart

This shows the age of the customers, the age or the area in which they were born, and the total amount they have spent on our store.
So the customer was born in 1940 and has spent the maximum amount which is $489.

#### 3. Scatter chart

Shows us the quantity discount and the unit price by the product name.

#### 4. Clustered Column Chart

 Presents data in vertical columns grouped by category, allowing users to compare values across different categories.

#### 5. Donut chart

That tells us which were the least products that were sold by quantity. The most products that were sold by quantity and the most products that were sold by the sales amount.
